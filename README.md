# Braille-Display
A prototype for a refreshable Braille display using Raspberry Pi.

# Aim                                                                                                                                     
● The aim of this project is to convert text to Braille Display.                                                                           
● It also speaks out characters as it displays.                                                                                           
● Can be used for educational purposes.                                                                                                   
● I have implemented the prototype using LEDs, but Vibration motors can be used in their place.
